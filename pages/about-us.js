      <SubTitle content="What drives us"></SubTitle>
      <p>We enhance the collaboration and the trust in the digital world by providing people with tools ensuring the safety and the ownership of their data. We focus on data distributed because we believe that they represent a better way to build our interactions with each other. For us, decentralization opens the way to a better balance of power on the network and to reducing the vulnerability of people and companies.</p>
