        We foster trust and collaboration in the digital world. Our goal is to develop tools
        providing people with data ownership all together with data safety. We focus on distributed
        technologies because we believe that they are a better way to build our interactions with
        each other. For us, decentralization is paving the way to a better balance of power, but
        also to reducing people and companies vulnerabilities in the digital world.

        actively participates and brings value to the project.
